Setting Up a WebSocket Server: we need a WebSocket server to communicate with your React application.
we can use libraries like ws for Node.js or any other WebSocket server implementation in your preferred programming language.

Install Dependencies: Navigate to your project directory to ServerApp in the terminal and run
npm install
It will add the necessary dependencies like ws

Start the WebSocket Server: Run the server script in your terminal:
node server.js

Chat Client
Install Dependencies: Navigate to your project directory to ServerApp in the terminal and run
npm install
Start the WebSocket client:
npm start

Access the Application in a Browser: Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or whichever port your React development server is running on). You should see the WebSocket chat interface.
You can open multiple browser tabs to simulate multiple users chatting.

By following these steps, you should be able to test the WebSocket chat application on your computer. Make sure to adjust the server port in both the WebSocket server script and the React application if necessary.
